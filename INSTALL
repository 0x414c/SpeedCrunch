Download is available from http://www.speedcrunch.org, the official website.

If you are installing SpeedCrunch from a disk image on an Apple Mac, all you
need do is drag the SpeedCrunch application icon to your Applications folder.
The application, and Qt itself, is in the bundle represented by the icon.

You need Qt (from Trolltech) at least version 4.2 to be able to compile
SpeedCrunch. Most Linux distributions normally already package the latest
version of Qt, so it is likely that you need to worry about this. However,
you need the development package as well (sometimes named as qt-devel or
qt4-devel, it depends on the distribution).

You also need CMake (from Kitware) at least version 2.4.4. CMake is available
for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Steps to install:

    - Create a sub-directory named 'build'
    - Go to this sub-directory
    - Run CMake like this:
        cmake ../src
    - Then run:
        make
    - To install, run (you might need administration privileges):
        make install
