Download is available from http://www.speedcrunch.org/, the official website.

If you are installing SpeedCrunch from a disk image on an Apple Mac, all you
need to do is drag the SpeedCrunch application icon to your Applications
folder. The application, and Qt itself, is in the bundle represented by the
icon.

You need Qt (http://www.qtsoftware.com/), minimum version 4.6, to compile
SpeedCrunch. Most Linux distributions normally ship a recent version of Qt, so
you will probably not need to worry about this. However, you need the
development package as well (sometimes named as qt-devel or qt4-devel,
depending on the distribution).

You may choose between QMake, the Qt framework bundled build system, and CMake
(http://www.cmake.org/) minimum version 2.4.4. CMake is also available for
Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Steps to build and install:
    cd src
    qmake (or "cmake .")
    make (or "nmake", or "gmake")
    make install (might require administrator privileges)

If using cmake, you can specify the installation prefix like this:
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING="</PREFIX/PATH>"
