Download is available from http://www.speedcrunch.org, the official website.

If you are installing SpeedCrunch from a disk image on an Apple Mac, all you
need do is drag the SpeedCrunch application icon to your Applications folder.
The application, and Qt itself, is in the bundle represented by the icon.

You need Qt (http://www.qtsoftware.com/), minimum version 4.4.0, to compile
SpeedCrunch. Most Linux distributions normally ship a recent version of Qt, so
you will probably not need to worry about this. However, you need the
development package as well (sometimes named as qt-devel or qt4-devel,
depending on the distribution).

You also need CMake (http://www.cmake.org/), minimum version 2.4.4.
CMake is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Steps to install:

    - Create a sub-directory named 'build'
    - Go to this sub-directory
    - Run CMake like this:
        cmake ../src
    - Then run:
        make
    - To install, run (you might need administration privileges):
        make install
